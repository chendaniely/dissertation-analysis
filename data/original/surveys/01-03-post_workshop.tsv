NA	1 day 4-5 hour workshop on the weekday	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	The instructor and helper were very approachable and set a tone of ""safeness and inclusion"" (regarding asking questions or reaching out for help and including captioning, highlighting that they value accessibility even though I did not require this, I notice and note these kinds of things and it affects my overall feel about a workshop) and that tone is so important for learners to really feel comfortable with learning new things about coding.	I liked the use of real data that we as biomedical/clinical researcher would use. I like learning concepts and then applying them in real ways using relevant data to I will use in my own research.	The live coding aspect could be greatly improved. And the pace was very fast, without any checking in on the learners to see if the pace needed to change. It was also completely unclear to me if learners were supposed to participate, despite there being exercises discussed in the workshop.

I hadn't studied logical regression before and it was a bit too fast paced for me to take in the concepts and coding at the same time.

I thought that worked very well.	I liked the cheerful and helpful nature of the instructors.	The topics went by too quickly for me to absorb. I would have benefitted from time to explore a topic on my own before proceeding to the next topic.

I stopped trying to code. I just listened so I would not miss the concepts. I am glad that the sessions were recorded.	That the sessions were recorded for future review	Too much material for two days. Either less material was needed or another day or two. Some topics seems to be too large to be covered in 25 minutes.
